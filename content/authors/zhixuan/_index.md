Zhixuan is a Research Associate at the University of Michigan, working on teaching machines to read, understand, memorize, and make use of zoning ordinances. Trained in Information Science and Software Engineering, she has always been an urbanist disguised as a tech person.
Ask her about Roosevelt Island history, Beijing city burger rankings, and the long, meditative hours she has recently spent with truck simulators. When she is not enthusiastically typing on her keyboard, you can find her out biking or bouldering.
