I recently completed my dual Master's degree in Landscape Architecture and Information Science from the University of Michigan. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning from Tongji University. Currently, I am working as a research assistant with Dr. Xiaofan Liang in the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. My research interests lie in GIS, transportation, urban analytics, and sustainable planning.
