I am an [Assistant Professor of Urban and Regional Planning](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/xiaofan-liang/) at Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am also affiliated with [UM Center for the Study of Complex Systems](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs). My research is driven by a passion for fostering inclusive networks and enabling participatory/collaborative planning processes through urban analytics. My approaches are largely inspired by the field of **network science**, **complex systems**, and **critical & participatory approaches** in GIS and planning, thus grounding my research in the pursuit of a diverse, equitable, and sustainable network society. 

My current work focuses on two themes: 1) examining how network infrastructure (e.g., transportation and social infrastructure) can simultaneously be inclusive and exclusive, offering connectivity and access for certain populations, places, or types of flows, while marginalizing or restricting others, 2) exploring how data, technology, and AI can support, transform, or challenge planning practices and public services. **I am currently looking for [an interested PhD](https://xfliang.notion.site/PhD-Invitation-to-work-with-Dr-Liang-e81f61ec6cd849cbad2e639880bca0f6) in AI and/or urban network systems direction (starting Fall 2025).**
