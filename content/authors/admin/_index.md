I am an [Assistant Professor of Urban and Regional Planning](https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/faculty/directory/xiaofan-liang/) at Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am also affiliated with [Michigan Institute for Data & AI in Society](https://midas.umich.edu/directory/xiaofan-liang/), [UM Center for the Study of Complex Systems](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs), and [Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program](https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/xiaofan-liang). My research is driven by a passion for fostering inclusive networks and enabling participatory/collaborative planning processes through urban analytics. My approaches are largely inspired by the field of **network science**, **complex systems**, and **critical & participatory approaches** in GIS and planning, thus grounding my research in the pursuit of a diverse, equitable, and sustainable network society. 

My current work focuses on two themes: 1) examining how network infrastructure (i.e., digital, social, or mobility) can offer connectivity and access for certain populations, places, or types of flows, while marginalizing or restricting others, 2) exploring how data, technology, and AI can support, transform, or challenge planning practices and public services. **I am looking for [an interested PhD](https://xfliang.notion.site/PhD-Invitation-to-work-with-Dr-Liang-e81f61ec6cd849cbad2e639880bca0f6) in Urban AI and/or Urban Network Systems direction (Fall 2025 application cycle closed; starting Fall 2026).**
