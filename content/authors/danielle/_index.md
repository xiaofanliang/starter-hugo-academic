Danielle Schulz is a second-year undergraduate student in the program of Urban Technology at Taubman College, University of Michigan. She is led by the curiosity regarding the underlying mechanisms in action in a city, the intricate relationship among them, and their various impacts in the vitality of the built environment. Danielle's interests revolve around access: to community, knowledge, education, leisure, and services. She sees in the city the possibility of utilizing data and technology to enable positive change, promoting equal access to resources that enhance quality of life in a equitable, sustainable, and ethical manner. Originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil, Danielle has led projects in arts, programming and community engagement, and currently volunteers in the field of Educational Robotics, while seeking to deepen her knowledge in ADA accessibility, GIS and CAD.
