        :speaker: **[ROLLING]** I am highly motivated to work with a PhD student who is interested in the urban AI and/or urban networks system direction, starting Fall 2026. Find more details at [PhD Invitation](https://xfliang.notion.site/PhD-Invitation-to-work-with-Dr-Liang-e81f61ec6cd849cbad2e639880bca0f6). 

        :speaker: **[ROLLING]** I am seeking to speak with *Network Practitioners* (broadly defined)! As part of my research, I’m looking to better understand how practitioners engage with multi-network urban systems—especially when the priorities of one network system impose tradeoffs, barriers, or unintended consequences on others. I’m interested in how people work through data complexity, representation mismatches, infrastructural interdependencies, and overlapping flows, particularly when the systems they work with operate at different scales, speeds, or purposes. Find more details at this [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xiaofan-liang-b5705481_interest-form-for-network-practitioners-activity-7346520911254069248-UmjH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABFFRnMB9Ulf66iu5vlWUTmOjdEDdhFHdCI).
