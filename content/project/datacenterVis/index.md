This work is in development with Matthew Wizinsky, Yajun Dai, Samuel Sav, Huy Dung Lou, and Katherine Cafaro. 

**Abstract**

The project examines data centers through three interrelated layers:

- People Layer: Who are the stakeholders in the data center ecosystem? What are their relationships, motivations, and jurisdictions of influence?
- Infrastructure Layer: What urban infrastructures (e.g., water, energy, utilities) are required to support data centers, and how are these systems connected?
- Governance Layer: What are the planning and community considerations—social, environmental, tax, land use, future of work—when a data center comes to town? What does the local approval process look like, and how can we estimate community impacts?
