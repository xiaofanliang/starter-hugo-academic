**Abstract**

As local governments start to embrace AI technology in application and governance, a big unknown lies at who has a say in the process and how different actors interact in shaping the application and governance landscape, especially when it comes to the sub-domain of AI applications. Using public documents released by the local governments as traces for technology governance and adoption, we first classified the public documents based on whether they are AI-relevant, defined as whether they mention AI regulation, governance, or application. Then we used large language model to help extract stakeholders from the document and form networks for analysis. 

**Keywords: AI governance; stakeholders; network**
